# Axios

Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from a web browser or Node.js. It provides a simple and intuitive API for performing asynchronous operations with a server.  
Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with Axios:

**Step 1: Installing Axios**
You can install Axios using npm or yarn, depending on your preference. Open your terminal and run one of the following commands:

Using npm:
`npm install axios`

Using yarn:
`yarn add axios`

**Step 2: Importing Axios**
In your JavaScript file, you need to import Axios to use it. If you're working with Node.js, you can import Axios as follows:

`const axios = require('axios');`
or in moduler javascript
`import axios from axios`

If you're working in a web browser, you can include Axios via a `<script>` tag or use a module bundler like Webpack.

**Step 3: Making GET Requests**
Axios provides a `get()` method for making GET requests. Here's an example of making a simple GET request to retrieve data from an API:

`
axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
`

In this example, `axios.get()` sends a GET request to the specified URL. The response is returned as a Promise, and you can use `.then()` to handle the successful response and `.catch()` to handle any errors that occur.
