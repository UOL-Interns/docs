**API Design**  
Design is the foundation of your API development. Swagger makes API design a breeze, with easy-to-use tools for developers, architects, and product owners.

**API Development**  
Protocols, error handling, and code modularity are just some of the questions your teams need to address before building a great API. Swagger provides tools for quickly prototyping and building your APIâ€™s functionality.

**API Documentation**   
Swagger takes the manual work out of API documentation, with a range of solutions for generating, visualizing, and maintaining API docs.

**API Testing**  
Start your functional, security, and performance testing right from the OpenAPI Spec. Swagger tooling and the ReadyAPI platform make it easy to rapidly create, manage, & execute API tests in your pipeline.

**API Mocking and Virtualization**  
Reduce dependencies in your development and testing cycles and stand-up realistic, dynamic mocks in seconds with Swagger and ReadyAPI Virtualization.

**Governance and Standardization**  
People and processes make up a successful API program. Efficiently managing these efforts makes for good governance. Whether you have a team of five or five hundred, Swagger can help.

**API Monitoring**
Monitor API availability, speed, and functionality starting from your OpenAPI Specification (OAS) with AlertSite for OAS. Automate monitor creation and instantly track API behavior to ensure everything runs smoothly in production.
